# Decision Tree Classifier for Drug Prediction

This project implements a decision tree classifier to predict certain drug prescriptions based on patient characteristics such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, and sodium-to-potassium ratio. The dataset contains patient data, and the classifier uses a decision tree model to classify blood pressure levels.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is in CSV format (`drug200.csv`). It includes the following columns:
- `Age`: The patient's age.
- `Sex`: The patient's gender (M or F).
- `BP`: The patient's blood pressure level (High, Low, or Normal).
- `Cholesterol`: The patient's cholesterol level (High or Normal).
- `Na_to_K`: The sodium-to-potassium ratio in the patient's blood.
- `Drug`: The drug prescribed.

## Requirements

To install the required dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
